👋 Hi, I'm Sanjana!

I'm a bioinformatics graduate student at Georgia Tech who enjoys working with messy biological data and turning it into something meaningful. I work with single-cell and multi-omics datasets, and I'm especially interested in how machine learning can help us understand complex biological systems. My work focuses on large-scale genomic data and building reproducible pipelines to extract insights from high-dimensional biological data.

I'm interested in roles at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and real-world data.

🔬 What I’m Working On

I’m currently working on understanding brain development in the mouse cortex. Specifically, I study how different archetypal cell identities exist within known cell types, how they emerge during development, and what functional roles they play.

I use tools like Scanpy, Seurat, Git, and other Python/R-based workflows to analyze single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, build reproducible pipelines, and explore gene regulatory mechanisms.
